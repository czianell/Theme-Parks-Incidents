# Theme-Parks-Incidents
The purpose of this data analysis is to seek patterns in guest incidents that took place after going on rides and to provide recommendations to limit unwanted incidents at Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando.

The dataset comes from Kaggle:

The dataset comes from the Florida government website listing incidents that have occurred at the two theme parks from 2002-2022 including the name of the ride, the age and gender of the guest, and a description of what happened to the guest.
